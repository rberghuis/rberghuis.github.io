Hey ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! You've reached my personal blog where I share a variety of gibberish ðŸ˜Š. 

I'm a Microsoft 365 Purview SME who specialises on Data Security & Compliance solutions for the Modern Workplace, helping enterprise successfully implement these at scale. Next to Microsoft Purview solutions, my work takes me across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem - from the Defender for Identity, Endpoint, Office etc. to Risk-based Conditional Access. From Teams Meeting Transcription & Recording to Retention Management, and deep-dived into the underlying technical architecture that powers Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. I absolutely hate manual labour, so I often get lost in VS Code where I write most of my PowerShell scripts and automation .

I'm a technical expert by heart and empower others to excel in their work by sharing my approach and lessons learned. I'm a big fan of data-driven decision-making, almost equal to my love of double espresso â˜•
