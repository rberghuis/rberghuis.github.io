Hey ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! You've reached my personal blog where I share a variety of gibberish ðŸ˜Š. 

I'm a Technical Expert that helps Enterprises implement Data Security & Compliance solutions at scale ðŸ§¡ I specialize in Microsoft solutions for the (secure) Modern Workplace. It means that I focus on Microsoft Purview, but not exclusively. You can find me working across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, from Defender for Identity, Endpoint, Office etc. to Risk-based Conditional Access. From Teams Meeting Transcription & Recording to Retention Management, and deep-diving into the underlying technical architecture that powers Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. The breadth and depth allows me to understand and communicate value and risks associated with the direction of changes I'm proposing. You can go all technical on me, and I can also translate the technical details to understandable management-level debriefings. Manual labour is an absolute no-go for me, so I often get lost in VS Code where I write most of my PowerShell scripts and automation.

I'm a technical expert by heart and empower others to excel in their work by sharing my approach, lessons learned and assets. I'm a big fan of data-driven decision-making, almost equal to my love of double espresso â˜•
